# Bamazon Homework Assignment

The goal here was to create a product purchasing app that allowed a custermer to:

- View a selection of items, their cost, and quantities within several different depts to      be purchased.
- Select the item number of interest from the id field when prompted with the questions of 
  "What would you like to purchase"? And "How many would you like to purchase"?

- Afterwards an updated view of the table would be available with the Stock Quantity field     updated with number of items remaining in stock.

- As well, if invalid data is entered, it will result in an error message.
